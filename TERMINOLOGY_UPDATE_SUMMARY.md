# Budget Planner - Terminology Clarification Update

## Summary of Changes Made

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Addressed**
The user clarified that only **ETF, Fixed Deposits, and SIP** should be considered as actual investments/savings. Any remaining budget balance (income - expenses - investments) should NOT be labeled as "savings" but rather as "budget balance" or "remaining balance".

### ðŸ“Š **Backend API Changes**

#### 1. Updated Chart Data API (`/api/chart-data`)
- **Added proper savings structure**:
  ```json
  "savings": {
      "sip": [],
      "fixed_deposit_one": [],
      "fixed_deposit_two": [],
      "etf": [],
      "total": []
  }
  ```

#### 2. Updated Yearly Charts API (`/api/yearly-chart-data/{year}`)
- **Changed terminology**:
  - `"savings"` â†’ `"investments"` (for actual SIP, FD, ETF)
  - `"savings"` â†’ `"budget_balance"` (for income - expenses - investments)

- **New data structure**:
  ```json
  "monthly_totals": {
      "income": [],
      "expenses": [],
      "investments": [],
      "budget_balance": []
  }
  ```

#### 3. Updated Monthly Analysis API (`/api/monthly-analysis-data/{year}/{month}`)
- **Changed calculations**:
  - `current_savings` â†’ `current_investments` (SIP + FD + ETF only)
  - `current_savings` â†’ `current_budget_balance` (income - expenses - investments)
  - `savings_rate` â†’ `investment_rate`

### ðŸŽ¨ **Frontend Template Changes**

#### 1. Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)
- **Stats Card**: "Net Savings" â†’ displays actual investments (SIP + FD + ETF)
- **Chart**: "Savings Trend" â†’ "Budget Balance Trend"
- **Chart Function**: `savingsTrendChart` â†’ `budgetBalanceChart`
- **Calculation**: Now shows budget balance = income - expenses - investments

#### 2. Yearly Charts (`yearly_charts.html`)
- **Summary Card**: "Total Savings" â†’ "Budget Balance"
- **Chart Label**: "Savings" â†’ "Budget Balance"
- **Chart Data**: Uses `budget_balance` instead of incorrectly calculated "savings"

#### 3. Monthly Analysis (`monthly_analysis.html`)
- **YTD Card**: "Monthly savings" â†’ "Monthly investments"
- **Analytics**: "savings_rate" â†’ "investment_rate"
- **Comparisons**: References to investments instead of savings

#### 4. Savings/Investments Dashboard (`savings_dashboard.html`)
- **Page Title**: "Savings Dashboard" â†’ "Investments Dashboard"
- **Navigation**: "Savings Dashboard" â†’ "Investments Dashboard"
- **Summary Cards**: Clarified terminology throughout

#### 5. Navigation (`base.html`)
- **Menu Item**: "Savings Dashboard" â†’ "Investments Dashboard"

### ðŸ”§ **Key Terminology Changes**

| "Savings" (input fields) | "Investments" | SIP + Fixed Deposits + ETF |
| "Savings Rate" | "Investment Rate" | Investments / Income * 100 |
| "Savings Trend" | "Budget Balance Trend" | Remaining money after expenses and investments |

### ðŸ’° **What Each Term Now Means**
